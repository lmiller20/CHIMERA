    "# Introduction: JWST Secondary Eclipse/Emission Tutorial  \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the simulated JWST emission/secondary-eclipse spectrum model/retrieval tutorial!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this particular setup, the atmosphere is parameterized within the \"chemically-consistent\" framework as described in Kreidberg et al. 2015, but for emission.  The atmospheric composition is parameterized with only a metalicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio assumed to be in thermochemical equilibrium along the temperature-pressure profile.  Originally this code would compute the gas and condensate phase mixing ratios by calling the NASA CEA routine. However, in order to remove fortran dependencies, a finely sampled pre-computed, interpolateable chemistry grid was instead produced with CEA as a function of temperature (T from 400K - 3400K in 100K increments), pressure ($log_{10}(P)$ from -7.0 (0.1$\\mu$bar) - 2.4 (316 bar) in 0.1 increments), metallicity ($[M/H]$ from -2.0 (0.01$\\times$) to 3.0 (1000$\\times$)), and C/O ($log_{10}(C/O)$ from -2.0 (0.01) to 0.3 (2) awkwardly spaced to better sample the transition about C/O=1). All elemental abundances are scaled with respect to the Lodders 2009 solar abundance pattern.  A pseudo-hack rainout approximation is made to the gas phase abundances of TiO, VO, Na, K, and FeH.  In this hack, these species are set to 0 abundance at levels above where they first fall below some critical value ($10^{-8}$). This is to mimic the loss of these species from the gas phase into the condensate phase. In no case are we accounting for the loss of elemental abundances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3-parameter temperature profile parameterization utilizes the Guillot 2010/Parmentier et al. 2014 analytic formulism (see Line et al. 2013a for implementation details).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This \"emission\" routine accounts for both stellar reflected and planetary thermal emission treated within the Toon et al. 1989 two stream + two stream source function technique (toonpy.py and toonpy_solar.py).  It accounts for multiple scattering given basic cloud optical properties (extinction efficiencies, single scatter albedo, and asymmetry parameter).   Instead of using line-by-line, or \"sampled\" cross-sections, this implementation uses the \"correlated-K\" method (see Lacis & Oinas 1990, or more recently Amundsen et al. 2017). Specifically, in multi-gas, multiple scattering atmospheres in \"emission\", the \"resort-rebin\" gas-mixing procedure has to be implemented (Molliere et al. 2015, Amundsen et al. 2017). Correlated-K is advantageous as it preserves the wavelength bin \"integrated\"  precision as line-by-line but with far less demanding computation.  We include as correlated-K line opacites H2O, CH4, CO, CO2, NH3, HCN, H2S, C2H2, Na, K, TiO, VO, FeH and as continuum gas opacities H2-H2, H2-He CIA, and the H- bound free and free free (e.g., Arcangeli et al. 2018).  See the \"opacity\" tutorial for more details on correlated-K. \n",
    "\n",
    "To handle the effects of disequilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing, we apply the \"quench-pressure\" approximation.  We include a quench pressure parameter for the carbon-system and one for the nitrogen system (as in Morley et al. 2017 for GJ436b, and Kreidberg et al. 2018 for WASP-107b).  The carbon quench pressure fixes the H2O, CO, and CH4 abundances above the quench pressure level to their abundances at the quench pressure level.  Similarly, the nitrogen quench pressure fixes the N2, NH3, and HCN abundances above the quench pressure to their values at the quench pressure level.  This is indeed a kludge, and a better implementation would be to use the timescale/eddy mixing prescription described in Zahnle & Marley 2015.  Regardless, any non-full kinetics approach is a kludge anyway (not to mention the 1D nature of the problem...).  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different cloud prescriptions built in.  The first is the Ackerman & Marley 2001 \"eddy-sed\" approach that self-consistently computes the vertical particle size distribution given a sedimentation factor, $f_{sed}$ and an eddy mixing factor (K$_{zz}$) from some cloud base pressure and intrinsic condensate mixing ratio.  The classic \"power-law haze\" and \"grey cloud\" prescripton is also included.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if one doesn't like the \"chemically-consistent\" concept, they can use the \"gas_scale\" array to switch off or scale the abundances each opacity source.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This specific notebook goes through the steps to generate the forward model, and illustrate how to actually perform the retrieval. However, the retrievals are bust run on a compute cluster or a node with more than 4 cores.  We will create a simulated JWST dataset using WASP-43b planet/star parameters, assuming the data will be binned to an R=100 (resolution of the correlated-K coefficients).\n",
    "\n",
    "Software Requirements: This runs in the python 3 anaconda environment.  It is also crucial that anaconda numba is installed as many of the routines are optimized using numba's \"@jit\" decorator (http://numba.pydata.org/). \n"
